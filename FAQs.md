### Why did you bother making this? ###
I created BBC as a personal project to learn how to create  [DHTML](http://www.w3schools.com/dhtml/dhtml_intro.asp) pages
(which is also why I didn't use the [HTMLTTChess](http://mip.noekeon.org/HTMLTTChess/index.html) package for rendering a nice chess board).

I am offering it as [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) to make chess more accessible to the world.

### Why would I use this? ###
Players who do not have any chess equipment can still play local games with friends using BBC as long as they have a browser on their computer and good Unicode support (virtually every computer nowadays). Players can also use it on their own to practice openings, replay games, and whatever else they would be able to do with a tangible chess set.

### What should I know before I use this? ###
BBC was made with the _Keep It Simple_ (KIS) principle in mind.
BBC does not use a chess engine, so you cannot play against the computer.
There are no constraints and no rule checking â€” **constraints and rules are to be enforced by the players** just like in an actual game.
This means that the players have to call check, mate, and make sure no illegal moves are played.

### I still can't decide if this is what I'm looking for... ###

Here is a short summary to find out if BBC is right for you.

_Pros:_
  * Virtually runs on any computer, regardless of operating system, as long as a browser is available
  * Free software (free as in freedom and free beer)
  * Open source software, modify it however you like!
  * Source code is well written, easy to understand (development version)
  * Simple functionality, don't get distracted by hundreds of features
  * User friendly interface
  * No internet connection needed (if running locally)
  * Very light application, runs fine on weaker machines
_Cons:_
  * No chess engine, so you cannot play the computer
  * No rules & constraints checking (although I personally consider this a pro as it requires players to be more alert)
  * Local games only, no network support

### Why a .org domain name? ###
BBC is hosted online at http://chess.kicks-ass.org. Domains ending with .org tend to be used for nonprofits; personal sites; open-source projects; and sometimes by commercial entities.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.org#Example_use

### What IDE / text editor did you use? ###
I used [Geany](http://www.geany.org/), it's a text editor / lightweight IDE.

### What browser did you test in / develop for? ###
I mainly test with Google Chrome. I occasionally test in Konquerer, Internet Explorer and Firefox as well, but don't be surprised if something seems weird when using those browsers with BBC.
